# Day 73: _Project 21: Local Notifications_, Part Two


This day covers the second and final part of `Project 21: Local Notifications` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/21)_.
You can follow along directly [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/73).


## 📒 Field Notes

> I previously created projects alongside _Hacking with Swift_ in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift). For _100 Days of Swift_, however, I've been extending things further and adding my projects to this repo under each "Part One" folder.
>
> With that in mind, Day 73 focuses on extending the `Local Notifications` project according to a set of challenges.


## 🥅 Challenges


### Challenge 1

> Update the code in `didReceive` so that it shows different instances of `UIAlertController` depending on which action identifier was passed in.

### Challenge 2

> For a harder challenge, add a second `UNNotificationAction` to the `alarm` category of project 21. Give it the title “Remind me later”, and schedule it to be shown in 24 hours.
