# Day 76: _Project 22: Detect-A-Beacon_, Part Two

This day covers the second and final part of `Project 22: Detect-A-Beacon` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/22)_.
You can follow along directly [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/76).


## ğŸ“’ Field Notes

> I previously created projects alongside _Hacking with Swift_ in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift). For _100 Days of Swift_, however, I've been extending things further and adding my projects to this repo under each "Part One" folder.
>
> With that in mind, Day 76 focuses on extending the `Detect-A-Beacon` project according to a set of challenges.



## ğŸ¥… Challenges


### Challenge 1

> Write code that shows a `UIAlertController` when your beacon is first detected. Make sure you set a Boolean to say the alert has been shown, so it doesnâ€™t keep appearing.

### Challenges 2 & 3

> Have your app register two or three other iBeacons. Now add a second label to the app that shows new text depending on which beacon was located.

> Use animation to accentuate the changing of different proximity states.
